title: Blog of the Capstone unit

Introduction:
The aim of this project was to make an online portal where students doing the capstone unit can view projects and apply
for roles within those projects.

My contribution:
during my time on the project I worked on the front end team, which was responsible for making the style of the website better match the style of Deakins website. I also worked on a lot of the documentation for bootstrap, planning, research etc.


my first  role on the front end team was to make the index page/header and footer more Deakin-esque, myself and Nick Boundris both did our own designs and compared the two and chose the best. We also gave each other feedback on what we done so far.

example here:
![image-title-here](/adamlock219.github.io/images/indexpage.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Nick told me to make the button
