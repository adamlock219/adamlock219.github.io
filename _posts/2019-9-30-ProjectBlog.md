title: Blog of the Capstone unit

Introduction:
The aim of this project was to make an online portal where students doing the capstone unit can view projects and apply
for roles within those projects.

My contribution:
during my time on the project I worked on the front end team, which was responsible for making the style of the website better match the style of Deakins website. I also worked on a lot of the documentation for bootstrap, planning, research etc.


my first  role on the front end team was to make the index page/header and footer more Deakin-esque, myself and Nick Boundris both did our own designs and compared the two and chose the best. We also gave each other feedback on what we done so far.

example here:
![image-title-here](/adamlock219.github.io/images/indexpage.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Nick told me to make the buttons magenta as it's a common occurence through out Deakins website and  i made the changes here.

although I was proud of the changes I made I think I hardcoded too often. This was not a good way to do it and I need to improve.

unfortutnately my design wasn't used in the final product but it was ok to see the quality you need to produce to be competitive.

I also did the sign-in and sign up button for the website but unfortunately I pushed it to the repository and the group didn't merge it to the final build.

I do however have the commits i made to bitbucket.

i also wrote a whole heap of documents on research for coding evironments, user guides for bootstrap.

![image-title-here](/adamlock219.github.io/images/web.png){:class="img-responsive"}

All in all I have shown what I have commited to the project and believe I should pass the unit based on this.
I haven't included all the  assessment tasks I have done, only what I committed to the project.
